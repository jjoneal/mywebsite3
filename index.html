        <center><b>A little about me :)</center>
        <center> I think I'm still on the good side of weird here but, I love to build with Legos and build PCs pretty much anything hands on I love to do. I'm what I call myself an omnivert not exactly an extrovert nor an introvert. I also want to move to Arizona someday because there is a camp called UCYC that I have worked for the past 2 summers and someday want to become full time. I also forgot to mention the speaker that you see in the picture is what I built. I used to own a company called Orion Vintique.</center>
